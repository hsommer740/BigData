Course Project : Getting and Cleaning Data
==========================================

The repository hosts my R code and relevant documentation files. The source for the dataset under analysis is : [Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

## Files

Note: All data should be extracted in the same folder, remain un-compressed and have no names altered.

The file `CodeBook.md` describes the variables, the data, and any transformations needed to clean the data.
The file `run_analysis.R` contains all the code to perform the analyses described in 5 easy steps.

The output of the 5th step is called `clean_data.txt`.
